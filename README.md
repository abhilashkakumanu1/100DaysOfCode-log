### Day 1: October 23 Friday - 4:00 Hrs
I have came across this awesome MOOC offered by Helsinki University - __fullstackopen__. I am planning to work on this course as a part of the 100DaysOfCode challenge.

__Learnt__: Websequencediagrams! UML diagrams to represent what's happening under the hood of a website. Spent a lot of time playing around with Network tab of developer console. I learnt that it's always good to keep developer console open.
