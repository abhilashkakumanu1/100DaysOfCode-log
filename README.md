### Day 1: October 23 Friday - 4:00 Hrs
I have came across this awesome MOOC offered by Helsinki University - __fullstackopen__. I am planning to work on this course as a part of the 100DaysOfCode challenge.

__Learnt__: Websequencediagrams! UML diagrams to represent what's happening under the hood of a website. Spent a lot of time playing around with Network tab of developer console. I learnt that it's always good to keep developer console open.

### Day 2: October 26 Monday - 3:00 Hrs
Worked on part1 exercises. Finished the course info exercise(1.1 - 1.5). Really liked the way in which exercises are building on top of each other. It's like we start with working code and are made to refactor it as we proceed further. Nice!

### Day 3: October 27 Tuesday - 4:00 Hrs
Finished part1 exercises (1.6 - 1.14). After that, started reading part2. Till now I haven't made any notes. Should focus on completing the part2 theory and notes for everything.

### Day 4: October 28 Wednesday - 6:00 Hrs
Finished part2 exercises (2.1 - 2.10). I am starting to love React because of this course. The way in which the concepts are slowly sinking in through exercises is superb! Looking forward for more...

### Day 5: October 29 Thursday - 3:30 Hrs
Read part3 throry part. Did 2.11 exercise. After finishing the part3 theory part, I have to make notes for all the parts before it's too late. Also, today I felt that code I wrote for a particular problem is ugly (even though it's working). It's good to see myself improve!
